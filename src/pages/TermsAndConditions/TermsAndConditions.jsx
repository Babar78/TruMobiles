            Please be aware that there may be instances where the Site is unable
            to process your order for various reasons. Therefore, the Site
            retains the right to cancel or decline any order at any time and for
            any reason. Additionally, the acceptance of your order is subject to
            the verification of your personal and credit card details. In
            certain cases, you may be requested to provide additional
            information, such as your phone number and address, to verify your
            identity before your order can be accepted.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a precaution against credit and debit card fraud, the Site
            reserves the right to verify the personal information you have
            provided or validate your payment details before shipping the
            product. This may include requesting verification documents such as
            an identity card, banking details, or proof of residence. If you
            fail to provide the required verification document/information
            within two (2) days of receiving the respective notification, your
            order will be automatically canceled. The Site also reserves the
            right to cancel any order directly if there is a suspicion of credit
            or debit card fraud.
            <br /> <br />
            While the Site strives to provide accurate and authentic information
            about product prices, errors in pricing information may occur. In
            the event that a product's price is inaccurately displayed on the
            Site, we reserve the right to cancel or refuse the order. However,
            at our sole discretion, we may contact you for further instructions
            regarding the order if the displayed product price is inaccurate, or
            we may cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation,
            regardless of whether your order has been confirmed and your credit
            card has been charged.
